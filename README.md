## What I Focused On

While building this portfolio, I prioritized:

**Clarity** – Every section has a clear purpose. No unnecessary complexity.  
**Storytelling** – Projects are explained through context, not bullet points.  
**Performance** – Fast builds with Vite, optimized assets, smooth animations.  
**Maintainability** – Component-based structure makes updates straightforward.  
**Accessibility** – Built with Radix UI primitives, tested for keyboard navigation.
